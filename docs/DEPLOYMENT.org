#+TITLE: Deploying FlatTrack
#+AUTHOR: Caleb Woodbine <calebwoodbine.public@gmail.com>

* Kubernetes (recommended)


* Docker-compose
The example set up in Docker-compose for FlatTrack is located in [[https://gitlab.com/flattrack/flattrack/-/blob/master/docker-compose.yml][../docker-compose.yml]]. This configuration is not considered production-ready, but for some may be a good enough option.
~Important notes~:
- the docker-compose deployment doesn't include SSL/TLS in the stack, so if you wish to deploy it you will need to add a reverse-proxy to handle SSL/TLS - this isn't something that FlatTrack implements.
- ensure that the credentials are updated 

#+name: deploy the docker-compose stack
#+begin_src sh :src ../
docker-compose up -d
#+end_src
