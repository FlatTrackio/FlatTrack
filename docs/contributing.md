# Contributing

How to contribute to FlatTrack.

## Code

For a dive into getting started in development, please read the [development docs](./development.md).
A good place to start is the [GitLab issues, filtering by issues which are good for new contributors](https://gitlab.com/flattrack/flattrack/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%25E2%259C%2593&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Good%2520for%2520new%2520contributors).

### Testing

Tests are written for the backend and frontend, please read the [testing docs](./testing.md).

## Community

### Engagement

Let others in the larger [FOSS](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community know about FlatTrack.

Outside of the FOSS community:

-   finding the needs of those living in flats
-   get others to try it and find their thoughts on the project

### Guidelines

You may wish to contribute to the [community guidelines](./community.md).

## Artwork & Design

Although not essential, it is a good idea to have an idea for frontend web development technologies.

## Documentation

Wanna help improve the documentation of FlatTrack?
For code related documentation the cycle is similar to the [development docs](./development.md).

For these docs:

-   go through the docs and see if all of the bases are covered (e.g: deployment, development, etc&#x2026;), then include what is not documented
-   consider new areas which could be documented
-   improve the quality of existing documentation
