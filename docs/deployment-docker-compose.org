* Deployment with Docker Compose

The example set up in Docker-compose for FlatTrack is located in [[https://gitlab.com/flattrack/flattrack/-/blob/master/deployments/docker-compose.yml][../deployments/docker-compose.yml]]. This configuration is not considered production-ready, but for some may be a good enough option.

Deploy the docker-compose stack:
#+begin_src sh :src ../
  docker-compose up -d
#+end_src

~Important notes~:
- the docker-compose deployment doesn't include SSL/TLS in the stack, so if you wish to deploy it you will need to add a reverse-proxy to handle SSL/TLS - this isn't something that FlatTrack implements.
- ensure that the credentials are updated

* Extra notes

To configure FlatTrack, please refer to the [[./configuration.org][configuration guide]].
